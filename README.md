audiolearn
==========

A machine learning demo using PyAudio and Scikits.  

## Dependencies
### Audio:  
sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio  
sudo pip install wave  

### Machine learning:
sudo pip install numpy  
sudo pip install scipy  
sudo pip install -U scikit-learn  

## To Do  
- [x] Record audio  
- [ ] Playback audio  
- [ ] Provide elementary audio visualization for clarity (either with playback or during recording) 
- [ ] Select machine learning technique  
- [ ] Record audio samples
- [ ] Extract features from audio  
- [ ] Implement machine learning technique  
- [ ] Select best features
- [ ] Observe accuracy metrics
- [ ] Do it all in real time (requires incremental algorithm, might not be feasible)
- [ ] Or at least be able to do it live
